Description
-----------
This patch does add an autoban to your bot. It will ban every leaver on the bot after the game has been finished.
The autoban will always trigger when a player left 5 minutes before a game has ended.

Config
------
There is a config setting which allow you to specify the autoban a little bit more.
You can define if the autoban should only ban real leavers or all players who left the game.
