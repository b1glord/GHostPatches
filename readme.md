This will be a collection for GHostPP patches.

How to patch ?
==============

Currently i tested only the UNIX OS.
Every patch include a .patch file. If you are using the default bot:
- Go to the rootghostdirection/ghost
- Copy the *.patch file here
- run this command:
   ````
   patch -p1 < filename.patch
   ````
- if you had the default bot the bot should be successfully patched without any problem
